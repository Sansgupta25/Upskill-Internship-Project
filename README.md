# ðŸš€ Project: Crop Production Prediction in India ðŸŒ¾

The project aimed to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the quantity of specific agriculture crop production in India. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of crop cultivation and production, I achieved reliable predictions to assist stakeholders in decision-making, resource allocation, and risk management.
The objective is to forecast the quantity of specific agriculture crop production in India with high accuracy, ultimately contributing to improved agricultural practices and food security in the country.

The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.

2. Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset to enhance the model's understanding of agricultural factors.

3. Model Training: Train different machine learning models, such as Decision Tree, Linear Regression, XGBoost, and Random Forest, on the training data.

4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

5. Model Selection: Select the best-performing model for crop production prediction.

The project aims to contribute to improved agricultural practices and food security in India by providing valuable insights and predictions to support decision-makers in the agricultural sector.
